This project

    - Was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

    - Uses JSONPlacerHolder as Fake Online REST API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

    - 's database is loacated in the root directory (db.json), pushed to GitHub in order to be able to use it through JSONPlacerHolder (http://my-json-server.typicode.com/francocaffiero/atix/)

    Notice that the online database is not persistent

    - Uses Material UI as a React component library for the UI (https://material-ui.com/)

    - Uses Material UI inline-styling (https://material-ui.com/styles/)

    - Uses Yarn as package manager (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

    - Uses react-router-dom for routing (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom/)

    - Uses gitHub as version control (https://github.com/), project (https://github.com/FrancoCaffiero/atix)

How to download and start the project:
-Open Terminal.
-Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
-Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL of the repository (https://github.com/FrancoCaffiero/atix).

    Running 'yarn start' or 'npm start', should be enough to start the application.

    In order to use the REST API required for this project, an internet connection is necessary.

Personal thoughts:
I decided to use Material UI since I am very familiar with and I believe is a library with simples React components but very useful.
About JSONPlacerHolder, I find it very easy to use altough the database is not persistent.
